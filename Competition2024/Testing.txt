- Teleoperated control from Xbox Controller
    - Drive with wheels on ground
    - Make sure it stops when we tell it to
    - Get a feel for how twitchy robot is, think about adding filters
- Encoder readings 
    - Manually turn each wheel a full rotation while printing output (1/gear ratio)
    - Push entire robot a distance and compare to readout using our methods
- Gyro readings
    - Spin robot 90, 180, 270, 360 degrees, compare that with printed output
- Tuning DriveDistance and PIDTurn (if there's time, we will have to redo for mechanisms)
    - Plugging in P, I, D variables and checking against encoder data
- Testing Auto
    - Test string parsing methods
        - Input CSV through Smart Dashboard (N1, B3, S4) => (N B S)(1 3 4)
        - What happens if we don't capitalize a letter or don't use spaces
        - Print out letter componnets and number components
    - Test conversion from components to points
        - Print out values assigned to selected Pose2d's
    - Test conversion from points to commands
        - Start with one point and have it drive to that
        - Try many different points relative to starting pose
        - Points directly in front, at angles, behind
    - Test sequencing
        - Same as with just one point but stringing multiple points together
        - Run multiple sequences, test edge cases like duplicate of points
    - Test unit 
        - Run realistic auto sequences
        - Throw in intake or shoot commands
